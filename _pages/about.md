Hi! I'm Jess and I'm the current Lab Manager for the [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/index.html) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2020 with a B.A. in Cognitive Science. As an undergrad, I worked as an RA with Prof. Mahesh Srinivasan and [Dr. Stephan Meylan](https://stephanmeylan.com/) in the [Language and Cognitive Development Lab](https://lcdlab.berkeley.edu/).

## Research Interest

I'm most excited when studying how children learn to communicate and interact with the world around them. I'm also curious about how words and meanings are generated and how they shift and evolve through communication. Broadly, I'm interested in the intersection between semantics, pragmatics, and the acquisition of the two. I like to approach these questions with computational models, cleverly designed experiments, and publicly available resources and datasets.

My current work explores ambiguity and polysemy in child contexts: which word meanings are children exposed to, and how do they use polysemy and ambiguity in their own speech?

## Some Facts About Me
* I accept they/them and she/her pronouns. This means I am comfortable being referred to with either set of pronouns, and appreciate a mix of the two. For example you can say "Jess is cool; I heard they're from LA! She was just complaining about the traffic." (If you'd like more information about using multiple sets of pronouns, [check out this great article by Kirby Conrod!](https://kconrod.medium.com/intermediate-pronoun-studies-multiple-pronouns-71e34cd28c54))
* Before I was a researcher, I was a babysitter, an IT consultant, a dog trainer, a teacher-in-training, and, briefly, an aspiring astrobiologist. I'm proud of my varied background and am always happy to chat about it!
* I have ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder; I've also struggled with Clinical Depression. I consider myself disabled and my neurodivergence informs much of how I approach my work.
* When I'm not staring at the computer, I'm usually knitting, cross stitching, bookbinding, printmaking, or picking up a new hobby of the month. I like to say I'm a "Jack of all trades, master of one or two." <!-- Check out the "fun" section of [projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}) to see some stuff I'm up to! -->

## Collaboration

I am most proud of the work I've done in collaboration with others. Science is inherently collaborative, and my experience has been no exception. These days, I work most frequently and closely with [Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/), [Virginia Marchman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/virginia-marchman), [George Kachergis](http://www.kachergis.com/), [Mika Braginsky](https://mikabr.io/), [Stephan Meylan](https://stephanmeylan.com/), [Sammy Floyd](https://www.sammyfloyd.com/), [Hugh Rabagliati](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/hugh-rabagliati), [Mahesh Srinivasan](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/mahesh-srinivasan), and [Sathvik Nair](https://sathvikn.github.io/)
