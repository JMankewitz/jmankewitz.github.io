title = {Multi-party referential communication in complex strategic games},
abstract = {Verbal communication is an ubiquitous aspect of human interaction occurring in many contexts; however, it is primarily studied in the limited context of two people communicating information. Understanding communication in complex, multi-party interactions is both a scientific challenge for psycholinguistics and an engineering challenge for creating artificial agents who can participate in these richer contexts. We adapted the reference game paradigm to an online 3-player game where players refer to objects in order to coordinate selections based on the available utilities. We ran games with shared or individual payoffs and with or without access to language. Our paradigm can also be used for artificial agents; we trained reinforcement learning-based agents on the same task as a comparison. Our dataset shows the same patterns found in simpler reference games and contains rich language of reference and negotiation.},

title = {Online Computerized Adaptive Tests (CAT) of Children's Vocabulary Development in English and Mexican Spanish},
abstract = {Purpose: Measuring the growth of young children's vocabulary is important for researchers seeking to understand language learning as well as for clinicians aiming to identify early deficits. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) are parent-report instruments that offer a reliable and valid method for measuring early productive and receptive language across a number of languages. CDI forms typically include hundreds of words, however, and so the burden of completion is significant. We address this limitation by building on previous work using Item Response Theory (IRT) models to create Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) versions of the CDI. We created CDI-CATs for both comprehension and production, for both American English and Mexican Spanish.
Method: Using a dataset of 7,633 English-speaking children ages 12-36 months and 1,692 Spanish-speaking children ages 12-30 months, across three CDI forms (Words & Gestures, Words & Sentences, and CDI-III), we found that a 2-parameter logistic IRT model fits well for a majority of the 680 pooled items. We conducted CAT simulations on this dataset, assessing simulated tests of varying length (25-400 items).
Results: We found that even very short CATs recovered participant abilities very well with little bias across ages. An empirical validation study with N=204 children ages 15-36 months showed a correlation of r=0.92 between language ability estimated from full CDI vs. CDI-CAT forms.
Conclusions: We provide our item bank along with fitted parameters and other details, offer recommendations for how to construct CDI-CATs in new languages, and suggest when this type of assessment may or may not be appropriate.},
